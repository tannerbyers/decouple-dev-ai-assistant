# CEO-Level AI Assistant Mode

Your AI agent has been transformed into a strategic, CEO-level assistant that responds concisely and focuses on results, not explanations.

## Response Style

Instead of verbose responses, your AI now responds like a strategic executive:

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Input**: "Set the AI agent task status to done"
- **Response**: "Task completed" or "Done"

### ‚ùå Issues
- **Input**: "Move task X to done"
- **Response**: "Issue: Task 'X' not found in Trello"

### üí° Strategic Questions
- **Input**: "How should I prioritize this week?"
- **Response**: "Focus on revenue-generating client work first, then process documentation. Block 60% time for sales activities."

## Trello Integration

The AI agent now integrates with Trello for CEO-level task management:

### Commands
- `"Set [task name] status to done"` - Moves task to Done list
- `"Check status of [task name]"` - Returns current task status  
- `"Add missing business tasks"` - Creates comprehensive task backlog
- `"Create task: [task title]"` - Adds new task to Trello

### Setup
1. Get your Trello API key from https://trello.com/app-key
2. Generate a token using the link on that page
3. Find your board ID from the URL: `https://trello.com/b/BOARD_ID/board-name`
4. Add these to your environment:
   ```
   TRELLO_API_KEY=your-api-key
   TRELLO_TOKEN=your-token
   TRELLO_BOARD_ID=your-board-id
   ```

## Business Task Generation

When you ask for "missing business tasks" or "create all tasks", the AI generates comprehensive tasks across all business areas:

- **Sales & Marketing**: Lead gen, content, outreach, proposals
- **Client Delivery**: Project setup, quality assurance, documentation  
- **Operations**: Processes, systems, automation
- **Financial**: Pricing, invoicing, metrics tracking
- **Product Development**: Features, testing, deployment
- **Team & Hiring**: Recruitment, onboarding, management

This ensures no critical business areas are left without actionable tasks.
