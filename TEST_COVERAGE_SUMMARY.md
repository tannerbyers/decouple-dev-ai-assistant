## Recent Additions

The lettered list task extraction feature that was recently added to handle AI responses with patterns like:
```
a. Create brand positioning document
b. Set up marketing automation
c. Develop content calendar
```

This feature is now **comprehensively tested** with:
- 14 dedicated tests covering all scenarios
- Real AI response patterns that caused the original issue
- Backward compatibility verification
- Edge case handling
- Project categorization testing

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **All tests fixed and passing!**
2. **Add integration tests** for thread context management
3. **Test business goals system** - Important for CEO features
4. **Test web dashboard** - User-facing functionality
5. **Add database operation tests** - Critical for data integrity

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest test_task_extraction.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=main --cov-report=html
```

The test suite provides good coverage of core functionality, especially the critical task extraction feature that was recently enhanced.
