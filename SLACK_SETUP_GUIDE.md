## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding?

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly
2. **Verify Permissions**: Bot needs `chat:write` permission
3. **Check Request URL**: Should be `https://decouple-ai.onrender.com/slack`
4. **Look at Logs**: Check Render logs for any errors

### Signature Verification Errors?

1. Ensure `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` matches your app's signing secret
2. Check your app's **"Basic Information" > "Signing Secret"**
3. Make sure the secret is set correctly in Render environment

### Performance Issues?

The bot typically responds in 2-3 seconds. If slower:
1. Check Render service health
2. Verify all API keys are valid
3. Consider upgrading Render plan for better performance

### Test Connection

Run our test suite anytime to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_slack_integration.py https://decouple-ai.onrender.com --signing-secret "$SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET"
```
